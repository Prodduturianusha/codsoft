    <p><strong> Salaar:Part-1 Ceasefire </strong> is a 2023 Indian Telugu-language &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action film directed by Prashanth Neel, known for the K.G.F. franchise, and produced by Hombale Films. The first part of a two-part story, the film stars Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran and is based on Neel's earlier work Ugramm. It follows the intense friendship and subsequent conflict between two friends in the fictional, dystopian city-state of Khansaar. The film is characterized by its large scale, lavish visuals, and action sequences, but has been noted for its dense narrative, underdeveloped character arcs, and reliance on a hyper-stylized aesthetic reminiscent of Neel's previous work. Plot & World:
                The story is set in the fictional city-state of Khansaar, which operates under an ancient monarchy. 
                The central conflict arises from a coup and a struggle for power between different tribal factions, as well as the fractured friendship between the lead characters, Deva (Prabhas) and Varadha (Prithviraj Sukumaran). </p>
